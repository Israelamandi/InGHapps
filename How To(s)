Certainly! Here's a line-by-line explanation of the code for implementing a Splash screen in Android using Java in IntelliJ IDEA:

```
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_splash);
}
```

- The `@Override` annotation indicates that we are overriding the `onCreate()` method from the superclass (in this case, `Activity`).
- `protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` is the method signature for the `onCreate()` method. This method is called when the activity is created.
- `super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)` calls the `onCreate()` method of the superclass, which is necessary for initializing the activity properly.
- `setContentView(R.layout.activity_splash)` sets the activity's layout to the `activity_splash.xml` layout file in the `res/layout` directory. This means that when the activity is created, the contents of this layout file will be displayed on the screen.

```
new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, NextActivity.class);
        startActivity(intent);
        finish();
    }
}, 3000); // 3000 milliseconds = 3 seconds
```

- `new Handler()` creates a new `Handler` object, which allows us to post `Runnable` objects to run on the main thread.
- `.postDelayed(new Runnable() {...}, 3000)` posts a `Runnable` object to run after a specified delay (in this case, 3 seconds or 3000 milliseconds). The `Runnable` object contains the code to start the next activity and finish the current activity.
- `new Runnable() {...}` creates a new `Runnable` object with an anonymous inner class. The `run()` method of the `Runnable` object contains the code to start the next activity and finish the current activity.
- `Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, NextActivity.class);` creates a new `Intent` object to start the next activity (in this case, `NextActivity.class`). The `MainActivity.this` argument specifies the current activity as the context for the intent.
- `startActivity(intent)` starts the next activity specified by the intent.
- `finish()` finishes the current activity, which removes it from the activity stack and frees up resources.
